Kirameter is a ui from a netflix tv show. 

The show did not post the website online,<br/>
here is a fun css excercise to copy cat the website 

Characteristics, 

1) Background has blue to red background from left to right
2) There is a network graph in constant motion in the background.
3) There is a small square grid that shows a portion of itself in the background.
4) Slider that changes from one color to another colors are currently unspecified.
5) Slider has a glow to the coloring.
6) Slider value is a picture of someones face and it is not a perfect circle, seems to be a transparent background image.
7) white outlines, button with white outline.

example:

## Things achieved so far, 
1) set background image, but this will soon be replaced with css linear-gradient
2) added multiple network graphs from highcharts with some css animations for motion.
